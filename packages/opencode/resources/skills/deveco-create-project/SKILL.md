description: Load this skill when creating, initializing, or scaffolding an ArkTS project, including "0-1", "from scratch", "new ArkTS project", "新建工程", "创建项目", and empty directory initialization tasks. Load this skill even if the target directory already exists — never assume an existing same-named directory is the user's intended project and skip to build_project/start_app. If the user provides a Chinese or other non-ASCII project name (e.g. 购物车, 天气预报), you MUST propose 2-3 UpperCamelCase ASCII candidates (e.g. 购物车 → ShoppingCart / ShopCart / Cart) and let the user choose via AskUserQuestion BEFORE invoking the script — never pass non-ASCII names through to the script, and never pick a single translation on the user's behalf. Use the skill's private TypeScript script to create ArkTS projects reliably.

# deveco-create-project

Use the skill's private script to create an ArkTS project, instead of relying on the model to copy template files one by one.

## Required Parameters

Confirm the following parameters before execution. Ask the user if any required value is missing:

| Parameter | Required | Default | Example |
|------|---------|--------|------|
| `projectPath` | Required | — | `/Users/yellow/Desktop/projects` |
| `appName` | Required | — | `HelloWorld` |
| `bundleName` | Auto-derived, no need to ask | `com.example.{appName lowercase}` | `com.example.helloworld` |
| `apiLevel` | Optional | Auto-detect from `DEVECO_HOME/sdk/default/sdk-pkg.json` | `21` |

### appName rules

`appName` must match `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,127}$`. Chinese / non-ASCII names are NOT allowed — the script will reject them (exit code `4`, `APP_NAME_INVALID`).

When the user provides a Chinese or other non-ASCII name, you MUST:
1. Propose 2-3 UpperCamelCase ASCII candidates based on meaning (e.g. `购物车` → `ShoppingCart` / `ShopCart` / `Cart`; `天气预报` → `WeatherForecast` / `Weather` / `Forecast`). Fall back to pinyin only when meaning is unclear.
2. Let the user pick one via `AskUserQuestion` before invoking the script — do NOT pick on the user's behalf, even if one option seems obviously best.
3. Never pass the original non-ASCII name to the script.

### Target directory conflict

If `{projectPath}/{appName}` already exists and is not empty, the script will exit with code `2` and emit a `PROJECT_EXISTS` JSON payload. When you see it, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` whether to overwrite, rename, or cancel — do NOT silently re-run or delete the directory yourself.

If the user explicitly specifies an SDK/API level, pass it through directly. It must fall within the supported range `17..defaultApiVersion`, where `defaultApiVersion` comes from `DEVECO_HOME/sdk/default/sdk-pkg.json` → `data.apiVersion`.
If the user does not specify one, do not let the model invent a version. Let the script auto-detect from `DEVECO_HOME/sdk/default/sdk-pkg.json`.

`DEVECO_HOME` must be configured and point to a valid DevEco Studio installation. If SDK metadata is missing or invalid, the script fails with a structured JSON error (`code`, `message`, `hint`) — there is no fallback API level.

### SDK / environment error handling (MANDATORY)

When the script exits with a non-zero code and emits one of the following error codes, you MUST **stop immediately** and report the `code`, `message`, and `hint` to the user. Do NOT attempt any recovery action:

| Error code | Meaning | Must NOT do |
|---|---|---|
| `DEVECO_HOME_MISSING` | `DEVECO_HOME` not set | Do NOT search for DevEco directories or ask for permission to set the env var |
| `DEVECO_HOME_INVALID` | `DEVECO_HOME` points to wrong dir | Do NOT suggest alternative paths or try to locate DevEco elsewhere |
| `SDK_PKG_MISSING` | `sdk/default/sdk-pkg.json` not found | Do NOT search for `sdk-pkg.json` elsewhere, copy/create it, or ask for permission to write into the SDK directory |
| `SDK_PKG_INVALID` | `sdk-pkg.json` not valid JSON or missing `data` | Do NOT attempt to fix or regenerate the file |
| `SDK_API_INVALID` | `data.apiVersion` missing / non-integer / < 17 | Do NOT guess an API level, fall back to a hardcoded value, or examine the SDK directory structure to infer/determine an API level |
| `SDK_PLATFORM_VERSION_MISSING` | `data.platformVersion` missing | Do NOT invent a platform version |
| `API_LEVEL_OUT_OF_RANGE` | User `--api-level` outside `17..defaultApiVersion` | Do NOT silently clamp or substitute |
| `API_CONFIG_MISSING` | No template mapping for the requested API level | Do NOT fall back to a different API level without explicit user consent |
| `TEMPLATE_DIR_MISSING` | Template directory not found | Do NOT attempt to locate template files elsewhere or create them from scratch |
| `TEMPLATE_COPY_INCOMPLETE` | Template copy missing required files | Do NOT attempt to manually create the missing files |

In all cases: **stop, report the JSON error payload verbatim, and let the user fix their environment before retrying.** Do not search the filesystem for SDK files, do not examine the SDK directory structure or scan subdirectories, do not copy/create `sdk-pkg.json`, and do not modify anything under `DEVECO_HOME/sdk/`.

The script's stdout JSON (`apiLevel`, `sdkVersion`, `source`, `detectedFrom`) is authoritative — do not re-read files under `{DEVECO_HOME}/sdk/**` to verify it.

### Optional: Brief Requirement Checklist for Complex App Requests

If the current session is already executing an approved Plan Mode plan or an existing plan file is referenced, do not create another plan, do not call `plan_enter` or `plan_write`, and do not ask for plan approval again. Treat the existing plan as the source of truth.

If there is no existing approved plan and the user asks to create a new project with a complex app requirement, make a brief requirement checklist before copying or editing files.

The checklist must list:
- pages to implement
- the first screen / entry page
- navigation between pages
- key feature points for each page
- verification points for pages and navigation

Keep this checklist concise and continue automatically unless required project parameters are missing or the requirement is contradictory.
Do not expand this skill into ArkUI design guidance; load `arkts-grammar-standards` before implementing UI code.

## Execution Steps

> `copy-template.mjs` reads the sibling skill directory `deveco-create-project/application/` as the template source by default.
> This script runs with Node.js. If `node` is not available in the environment, stop immediately and explain that to the user.
> Default skills are extracted to a local user skill directory before execution. Keep all scripts in this skill self-contained and do not import repo-only source files.

### Step 1: Run the Private Script

Run the following with Shell:

```bash
node "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/copy-template.mjs" --project-path "{projectPath}" --app-name "{appName}" --bundle-name "{bundleName}" --api-level "{apiLevel}"
```

If `apiLevel` is not explicitly provided by the user, omit `--api-level` and let the script detect it from DevEco metadata.

Execution requirements:

- Do not manually copy template files one by one.
- Let the script handle recursive copying, binary asset copying, placeholder replacement, and basic validation.
- The script is responsible for SDK detection. Do not decide the SDK version in the prompt by guesswork.
- If the script exits with a non-zero code, report the JSON error payload (`code`, `message`, `hint`) to the user and stop.

### Step 2: Verify the Result

At minimum, verify that the following file exists:

- `{projectPath}/{appName}/build-profile.json5`

If the file is missing, treat the creation as failed and do not proceed to later compile or page-generation steps.

### Step 3: Session Context (Automatic)

After `bash(copy-template.mjs)` succeeds (exit code 0), the session working directory is **automatically** set to the generated project root (`{projectPath}/{appName}`). You do **not** need to call `switch_cwd` — proceed directly to reading template files and writing business code.

If the auto-switch confirmation does not appear in the bash output, or if you change to a different project manually later, use `switch_cwd` as a fallback.

### Step 4: Continue Feature Work in the Generated Project

If the user's request includes app behavior, UI, pages, or business requirements in addition to project creation, continue only after the project directory is created and the session context is set (Step 3).

Before implementing the feature:

1. Read `AGENT.md` in the project root — it lists exactly which files to read and which to skip.
2. Follow AGENT.md's guidance to read only the necessary files (typically `main_pages.json`, `Index.ets`, `EntryAbility.ets`).
3. Do NOT glob/search the project tree blindly — AGENT.md already identifies what you need.
4. Modify the actual launch page or its navigation path so the requested feature is reachable from the first screen.

> **CRITICAL: `EntryAbility.ets` and `main_pages.json` must stay in sync.**
>
> `EntryAbility.ets` calls `windowStage.loadContent('pages/SomePage', ...)` to load the first screen.
> That page path **must** appear in `main_pages.json`'s `src` array — otherwise the framework silently fails to load the page, resulting in a **white screen**.
>
> When you create custom pages and update `main_pages.json`, you **must** also update `EntryAbility.ets`:
> - If you **rename or replace** the first entry in `main_pages.json`, update `loadContent()` to match the new first page.
> - If you **prepend** a new splash/landing page to `main_pages.json`, update `loadContent()` to point to that page.
>
> Always re-read both files after editing to confirm they are consistent.

- Do not finish by only creating a new named page/component unless the launch page routes to it.
- After changes, run `build_project`; if it succeeds, run `start_app`.

### Step 5: Report Back to the User

Report after all requested creation, implementation, build, run, and verification work is complete, or immediately when a blocking failure stops the flow.

Output:

- The absolute project path
- App name / bundle name / API Level
- `source` of the selected API level: `user_input` / `sdk_pkg`
- Whether the template integrity check passed
- Whether session context was set (auto-switched or manual)
- Build/run/verification status when feature work was requested
