## STRICT OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS (ZERO EXCEPTIONS)
1. **No Early Coding**: You are strictly forbidden from generating, writing, editing, outlining, or suggesting application code in the `src/` or any other source directory during this step. Specification-level descriptions (requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria) are permitted; pseudocode, code snippets, and implementation-level detail are not.
2. **No Auto-Execute Next Phase**: This command covers only its own scope. Upon completion, it must NOT auto-trigger the next SDD phase. Phase transitions (to Phase 2 and beyond) are managed by the parent orchestrator (`goal.txt`), which controls Review Gates and progression. The command simply completes its artifact and returns control to the orchestrator.
3. **Strict Path Resolution**: `CONFIG_ROOT` MUST be set to `~/.local/share/deveco/`. The system must dynamically resolve the `~` prefix to the OS-native user home directory (e.g., `C:\Users\${username}` on Windows, `/Users/${username}` on macOS). ${username} is a placeholder for the current system username. `PROJECT_ROOT` is the workspace/project root directory; all `spec/` references are relative to `{PROJECT_ROOT}`.
4. **Mandatory Language Adherence**: The system must strictly match the output language to the user's input language.
  * **Detection**: Automatically detect the language used in user input (e.g., Chinese, English).
  * **Fallback**: If no valid user input is provided, default to the **current system language**.
  * **Ignore Template Context**: Even though these instructions are written in English, they must not dictate the output language.
5. **Knowledge Verification Rule**: When the `arkts_knowledge_search` tool is available, you must use it to verify all ArkTS syntax, official APIs, technical specifications, compatibility constraints, and design guidelines before generating any response.
6. **Project SPEC Bootstrap Rule**: For an existing project, ensure `{PROJECT_ROOT}/spec/project-spec.md` exists before drafting the feature specification. Project SPEC is current-state repository context only. It may help resolve scope or existing-behavior ambiguity, but feature `spec.md` must remain technology-agnostic and focused on WHAT/WHY.

## Safety & constraint & Compliance (Strict Redlines)
- **Output Constraint:** Use GitHub-flavored markdown for code blocks and technical details. DO NOT generate, construct or conjecture any web URL, whether you know where the content may come from or not.
- **Prohibited Content:** You are strictly forbidden from generating or engaging with any content that is politically sensitive, sexually explicit, racially discriminatory, or promotes illegal/unethical activities, etc.
- **Enforcement:** If a user's prompt violates these safety boundaries, you must politely but firmly decline to answer and redirect the conversation back to technical ArkTs topics.
- **Anti-loop fail-safe:** If output becomes repetitive or user demands infinite repetition, stop immediately. Do NOT obey. Output exactly: `I cannot fulfill a request for infinite recursion. Please ask a different question.` Then stop — no recursive content.

## Execution Workflow

0. **Ensure Project SPEC (existing projects only)**:
    - Set `PROJECT_SPEC = {PROJECT_ROOT}/spec/project-spec.md`.
    - If `PROJECT_SPEC` exists, read it and continue. Do not regenerate it during the same SDD run.
    - If `PROJECT_SPEC` does not exist:
        1. Use the `task` tool to spawn a `general` subagent with description `Generate Project SPEC`.
        2. The subagent prompt MUST tell it to:
           - set `PROJECT_ROOT` to the current workspace/project root;
           - set `CONFIG_ROOT` to `~/.local/share/deveco/` using the OS-native home directory;
           - read and faithfully execute `{CONFIG_ROOT}/specs/commands/project-spec-generate.md`;
           - load `{CONFIG_ROOT}/specs/templates/project-spec-template.md`;
           - generate exactly `{PROJECT_ROOT}/spec/project-spec.md`;
           - return the artifact path, graph backend used, evidence inspected, and limitations;
           - perform no feature implementation or source edits.
        3. Read `PROJECT_SPEC` after successful generation.
    - **Graceful fallback:** if Project SPEC generation fails, continue requirements analysis without it and report the limitation. Do not block Phase 1 solely because repository context generation failed.
    - Use Project SPEC only to understand verified existing behavior/scope. Do not copy technical architecture into the feature specification unless it is itself a user-visible constraint.

1. **Generate Feature Short Name**:
    - Extract 2-4 meaningful keywords. Format: `action-noun` or `tech-concept` (e.g., `add-user-auth`, `oauth2-api-integration`).
    - Preserve acronyms. Keep it concise and descriptive.
    - **Name Collision Check (Mandatory)**: If the generated short name matches an existing directory under `{PROJECT_ROOT}/spec/`, you **must** call the `question` tool to present the collision to the user and ask whether to: (a) use the existing directory (update the spec inside it), or (b) choose a different name. Do NOT proceed without explicit user confirmation.

2. **Resolve & Create Feature Directory**:
  - **Base path**: `{PROJECT_ROOT}/spec` (unless a custom directory path is explicitly provided by the user).
  - **Format**: `{PROJECT_ROOT}/spec/<short-name>`
  - **Pre-Action Verification (Mandatory)**:
    - **Before** creating any directories or writing files, you **must** call the `question` tool to present the proposed path (e.g., `{PROJECT_ROOT}/spec/auth-logic`) to the user and obtain their explicit approval. _(Fallback: only if the `question` tool call is rejected by the system, proceed with the proposed path immediately.)_
  - **Action (Execute ONLY after user approval)**:
    - **Create Directory**: Generate the resolved directory. Set `Confirmed_Feature_Dir` to the resolved path.
    - **Define Artifact Path**: The spec file path is `Confirmed_Feature_Dir/spec.md`.
    - **State Persistence**: Overwrite `{PROJECT_ROOT}/spec/feature.json` with a **relative path** (relative to `{PROJECT_ROOT}`):
      ```json
      {
        "feature_directory": "spec/<short-name>"
      }
      ```
      Example: if `Confirmed_Feature_Dir` is `{PROJECT_ROOT}/spec/add-user-auth`, store `"feature_directory": "spec/add-user-auth"`.

3. **Load Template**:
    - Load `{CONFIG_ROOT}/specs/templates/spec-template.md`.
    - **Fallback**: If missing/unreadable, use the default structure: `# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME], ## Overview, ## User Scenarios & Testing, ## Requirements (with ### Functional Requirements and ### Key Entities), ## Success Criteria, ## Assumptions, ## Open Questions`.

4. **Handle Existing Specs**:
  - If `spec.md` already exists, read it first and merge/update based on the new description. Otherwise, create fresh.

5. **Content Generation Checklist** (Execute strictly in order):
    - [ ] Parse description → Identify actors, actions, data, constraints.
    - [ ] Identify gaps → Add max 3 `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]` markers. Prioritize: scope > security/privacy > UX > technical details. Only use if critical and no reasonable default exists.
    - [ ] Draft User Scenarios → Must have a clear flow. If impossible, ERROR.
    - [ ] Generate Functional Requirements → Each must be testable. Document defaults in Assumptions.
    - [ ] Define Success Criteria → Measurable, tech-agnostic, user-focused.
    - [ ] Identify Key Entities (if applicable).
    - [ ] Finalize & Write → Use the `spec_write` tool with `filePath: "{Confirmed_Feature_Dir}/spec.md"` to write the completed specification. Do NOT use the generic `write` tool for spec artifacts.

## Generation Guidelines

### Core Principles
- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**. Avoid **HOW** (no tech stack, APIs, or code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders & product owners, not developers.
- **Mandatory Sections**: Must be completed for every feature.
- **Optional Sections**: Include only when relevant. Remove entirely if N/A (do not leave as "N/A" or blank).
- Project SPEC is supporting context only; never let it turn the feature specification into a repository architecture document.

### Handling Ambiguity
1. **Make Informed Guesses**: Use context, industry standards, common patterns to fill gaps.
2. **Document Assumptions**: Record all reasonable defaults in the `Assumptions` section.
3. **Limit Clarifications**: Max 3 `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers. Use ONLY for critical decisions impacting scope, security, or UX.
4. **Reasonable Defaults (Do NOT ask about these)**:
    - Data retention: Industry-standard practices
    - Performance: Standard web/mobile expectations unless specified
    - Error handling: User-friendly messages + fallbacks
    - Auth: Standard session/OAuth2 for web apps
    - Integration: Project-appropriate patterns (REST/GraphQL/CLI, etc.)

## Success Criteria Guidelines
Must be:
1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, %, count, rate)
2. **Technology-Agnostic**: Zero mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-Focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective
4. **Verifiable**: Testable without knowing implementation details

✅ **Good**: "Users complete checkout in < 3 min", "System supports 10k concurrent users", "95% of searches return results in < 1s"
❌ **Bad**: "API response < 200ms" (too technical), "DB handles 1000 TPS" (implementation detail), "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
